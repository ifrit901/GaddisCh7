 * 13. Name Search
 * 
 * If you have downloaded this book's source code (the companion  
 * web site is available at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis), you 
 * will find the following files in the Chapter 7 folder:
 * 
 * - GirlNames.txt - This file contains a list of the 200 most 
 *   popular names given to girls born in the United States 
 *   for the years 2000 - 2009. 
 * - BoyNames.txt - This file contains a list of the 200 most
 *   popular name given to boys born in the United States
 *   for the years 2000 - 2009. 
 * 
 * Write a program that reads the contents of the two files into
 * two separate arrays, or ArrayLists. The user should be able to 
 * enter a boy's name, a girl's name or both, and the application
 * will display messages indicating whether the names were among
 * the most popular.
